            <h3> I started programming at the age of 12. Until attending UMass, I primarily learned languages such as HTML and CSS on my own through YouTube tutorials and online articles. I also got the opportunity to learn the basics to a variety of languages (Python, HTML/CSS, Arduino, etc.) through summer camps.</h3>

            <h3>At UMass, I have taken the following programming courses: Introduction to Programming (Python), Object-Oriented Programming (Python and Java), Introduction to Informatics (Python and HTML/CSS), and Data Structures (Java).</h3>

            <h3> Over Summer 2023, I started learning UI/UX basics and principles through the Google UX Design Professional Certificate on Coursera! In the first three courses, I've learned the basics of the UX Design process, how to build wireframes, and how to use Figma to design low-fidelity prototypes. Currently, I'm on the fourth course, which details the processes of UX Research. I've had a great time learning and working on my first portfolio project, an app that helps people easily and efficiently find musical entertainment for their weddings.</h3>

            <h3>Throughout this process, I've learned that my favorite parts of the UI/UX cycle are the user research, wireframes/prototypes, and testing! I'm eager to continue learning more and exploring my interests.</h3>

            <h3> I've been documenting my progress on Google Slides. As of right now, the slide deck is incomplete as I am still making my way through the Certificate. Feel free to look through what I have so far!</h3>
